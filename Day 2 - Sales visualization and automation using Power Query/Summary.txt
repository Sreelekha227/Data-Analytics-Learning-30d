SALES VISUALIZATION AND AUTOMATION USING POWER QUERY


AIM - To analyze the two sales data(2021 & 2022), perform automation using Power Query and finally visualize the result data.


Initially, I have creted 2 Excel files/Dataset (2021,2022) that contains sales data of the respective years.


Now I am gonna preprocess/Clean the datasets :

    In this simple dataset, the issues to be cleaned includes

        -> Combine 2021 and 2022 file
        -> Serial NO, OredrID, Order Date Columns are not needed
        -> Received date is not needed instead a column containing year is enough
        -> Mr./Mrs. column and Name column should be combined
        -> Rs should be removed, number alone is enough

    As this is a small dataset, We can do the cleaning process manually, but what will we do in case of large datasets ?

      So, there comes the need for automation using Power query

    STEPS :

        1. Create new Excel Sheet
        2. Combining Datasets 
        
            Data -> Get Data -> from files -> from folder -> Select the folder -> Choose Combine transform data -> OK
            Power Query editor will be opened

        3. Right click on the unwanted columns and click remove 
        4. Split

            Click split -> Delimitor -> each occurence of Delimitor -> OK

        5. Merge Columns

            select the first column, press ctrl and selct the second column and click merge -> custom -> .

        6. Close and Load

Visualize using charts

    insert charts

Even if we add multiple files to the folder, after refreshing it gets updated in the sheet.

SALES VISUALIZATION AND AUTOMATION USING POWER QUERY


AIM - To analyze the two sales data(2021 & 2022), perform automation using Power Query and finally visualize the result data.


Initially, I have creted 2 Excel files/Dataset (2021,2022) that contains sales data of the respective years.


Now I am gonna preprocess/Clean the datasets :

    In this simple dataset, the issues to be cleaned includes

        -> Combine 2021 and 2022 file
        -> Serial NO, OredrID Columns are not needed
        -> Order Date and Received date are not needed instead a single column containing year is enough
        -> Mr./Mrs. column and Name column should be combined
        -> Rs should be removed, number alone is enough

    As this is a small dataset, We can do the cleaninjg process manually, but will we do in case of large datasets ?

      So, there comes the need for automation using Power query

    STEPS :

        1. Create new Excel Sheet
        2. Data -> Get Data -> from files -> from folder -> Select the folder
